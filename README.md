# Challenge collecting data @BeCode

## Purpose
Create a program in python using web scraping and python libraries to create a dataset of Belgian real estate listings

##Objectives
- Be able to scrape a website
- Be able to build a dataset from scratch
- Be able to implement a strategy to collect as much data as possible

## Why
We are collecting this data for a fictitious real estate company who wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium.

## How
We have to scrap any belgian real estate agency website for information. The dataset(.csv) has to include the below columns:

    Locality
    Type of property (House/apartment)
    Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)
    Price
    Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
    Number of rooms
    Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
    Furnished (Yes/No)
    Open fire (Yes/No)
    Terrace (Yes/No)
        If yes: Area
    Garden (Yes/No)
        If yes: Area
    Livable surface area
    Surface area of the plot of land
    Number of facades
    Swimming pool (Yes/No)
    State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)
